## Overview

The purpose of a Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) is to provide a
defined, repeatable way of working that manages IT risks associated with
software development.  It is a governance framework which forms a _definition_
of how things should be done, which should be adhered to in _implementation_,
which produces _proof_ of conformance.
