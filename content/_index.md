# The Secure SDLC Process Template


## Overview

The secure SDLC process template is an open source definition for a software 
delivery process. You can fork this template to satisfy the software delivery process 
requirements for any industry standard, including SOC2, ISO27001, IEC62304, NIST, FedRAMP, etc.

If you are struggling to define a software delivery process for compliance with any 
standard, and you're not really sure what to do, and you just want an easy button 
for a generic SDLC - you can fork this repo.

As an example, we recently forked the repo ourselves as part of our SOC2 process. 
You can see what that looks like over here https://sdlc.kosli.com/

Lastly, if you're interested in discovering how to automate the *proof* that you're 
following your SDLC - gathering evidence for tests, scans, pull requests, etc
