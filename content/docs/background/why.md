# Why do regulated organization need a software process?

Regulated organizations such as banks, insurance companies, and payment
platforms obtain their license to operate from a government authority.   As a
critical element of the country's economy, and also to protect consumers, these
organizations are required by law to manage various operational risks in their
use of information technology.  For example, in Norway this regulating authority
is Finanstilsynet, and the applicable law is the IKT forskrift.

In other countries the laws and regulations differ, but the principle is
internationally followed.


Typical obligations in this framework include having processes around how IT
systems change, and managing the risks associated with changes.  Crucially, it
is expected that there are comprehensive records of these changes, and the risk
mitigations and internal controls performed as part of the changes.

This record of your changes should also contain evidence that your developers
are following your process and performing risk controls.
