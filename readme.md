# Secure SDLC process template

Tl;dr if you are struggling to define a software delivery process, or you're not really sure what to do, or it just feels like a bunch of hassle and you just want an easy button for a generic SDLC - fork this repo. 

The secure SDLC process template is an open source definition of a software delivery process. You can fork this template to satisfy the software delivery aspect of an industry standard.

Regulated software companies like banks, fintechs, healthcare providers, medical device manufacturers, automotive companies, etc. need to comply with government legislation and/or industry standards (IEC 62304, 21 CFR Part 11, ISO26262, NIST, FDA, etc.) before they can take products to market and sell to customers.

Many non-regulated companies also choose to opt-in to voluntary standards like SOC2 and ISO27001 to win the confidence of their customers.

To achieve compliance with any of these regulations and standards you must define a software delivery process, implement it, and then prove that the process is being followed.

This is why you need a software process, and in our experience many people struggle with the initial task of defining one.

As an example, we recently forked this repo ourselves as part of our SOC2 process. You can see what that looks like over here https://sdlc.kosli.com/
