# Secure SDLC process template

The secure SDLC process template is an open source definition of a software delivery process. 

If you are struggling to define a software delivery process, or you're not really sure what to do, or it just feels like a bunch of hassle and you just want an easy button - fork this repo. 

This template will satisfy the software delivery aspect of an industry standard including SOC2, ISO, IEC, FDA, FedRamp, etc.

As an example, we recently forked this repo ourselves as part of our SOC2 process. You can see what that looks like over here https://sdlc.kosli.com/
